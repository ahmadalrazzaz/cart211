      <p class="terms-intro">
        To continue your smooth, personalized experience, please review and accept
        our Terms & Conditions. We've highlighted the key points below.
      </p>

      <div class="terms-scrollbox">
        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          By using this experience, you allow us to process certain technical and
          behavioral data. This helps personalize your content, track engagement,
          and improve performance.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Cookies & Local Storage</h2>
        <p>
          We use cookies, local storage, and similar tools to remember preferences,
          track interactions, and calculate your cookie funds. These may stay active
          even after you close this page.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Personalization</h2>
        <p>
          Content, offers, and recommendations may be tailored based on your
          scrolling, clicks, time spent on elements, and interactions with
          mini-games or features.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          We may share aggregated or pseudonymous data with selected partners for
          analytics, optimization, and security. Some partners may combine it with
          data they already have.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Cookie Funds & Balance</h2>
        <p>
          During this experience, you may earn “cookie funds” — a visual
          representation of your engagement. These do not act as real currency and
          cannot be exchanged for cash.
        </p>
        <p class="terms-hidden-clause">
          (i) By continuing, you give us a transferable, irreversible license to reuse,
          convert, or resell your cookie fund history and related telemetry for any
          current or future service, partner or product, without extra notice.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
        <p>
          You may leave at any time. By scrolling, staying, or choosing any option
          below, you confirm that you have read and agree to these Terms &
          Conditions.
